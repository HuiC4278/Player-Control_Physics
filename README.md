The project's purpose is to make a character move with W, A, S and D or the arrow keys and have a camera following the player when moving around the area. 
The project will also allow the player to interact with their surroundings, with objects to collide with from the Rigidbody affecting them with and a collectable item to demonstrate trigger zones.
